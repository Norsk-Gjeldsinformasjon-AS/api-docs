Unsecured debt include credit card debt, personal loans, and other forms of non-secured borrowing.


### How often is the debt information updated?

The information you receive are always updated to the best of our effort. On every query we contact the financial institutions where the user have debt to fetch the latest data.

If a financial institution fail to answer within the allotted time, we will fall back to cached data. Our cached data are fetched every morning and updated by the financial institutions throughout the day as soon as debt for an individual is changed. This is reported in the debt information response.
